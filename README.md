__runtime_typing__ is a python module to be used for the easy implementation of runtime type checks. Type constraints provided in terms of the [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) module can be used to validate function parameters and return values during runtime. Functions are exposed to type validation by being decorated with the `@typed` decorator.
